# ceasers-trading
A project that attempts to train, implement, and eventually actually trade cypto currency using AI market predictions.

# roadmap
1. Research the path and devlop the workflow

2a. Implement an AI interface that is trainable and produces predictions

2b. Implement an API call that takes in recent market data, as well as implement functions to send commands to the trading platforms

3a. Train the AI based on the API information to make predictions

3b. Create functions that process API data into a format that is consistent with the dataset the AI is trained on

4. Create functions that actively test the AI and will evaluate predictions.

5. Adjust the algorithms and repeat testing until producing a desired return.

6. Test the AI on a different dataset before integrating it with live markets.

Possible Final Step:

7. If the project is proven to work in mock markets, possibly try it against actual trading platforms.
